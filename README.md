## Important Note

## Description 
This web application was created to simulate an online retailer for boba milk tea. Users will be able to browse a menu of beverages, modify
the drink options & add-ons, and add or remove items from their shopping cart. The website is fully-responsive and can be viewed on mobile, tablet, or desktop screen sizes.
