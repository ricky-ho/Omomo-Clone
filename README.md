Check out the application at [https://omomoteashoppeclone.netlify.app](https://omomoteashoppeclone.netlify.app/).

## Important Note
This shopping cart project was designed using https://www.omomoteashoppe.com/ as inspiration. 
All of the images and major designs were replicated from their official site. All copyrights go to OMOMO Tea Shoppe. 
This project is only for my personal educational purposes.

## Description 
This website project was created to simulate an online retailer. Users will be able to browse a menu of beverages, modify
the ice level, sweetness, dairy options, and toppings for each beverage, and add or remove them from the shopping cart.
The website can be viewed on any screen and is mobile responsive.
